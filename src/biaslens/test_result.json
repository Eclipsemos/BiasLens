        "abstract": "Daniel McCarthy argues that Pope Francis's pontificate was tailored for an era of globalization that has since shifted. He suggests the Catholic Church now needs a populist pope who can reconnect with the Western working class and emphasize traditional moral teachings. The author believes this approach would be more effective in evangelizing the West than Francis's strategy.",
