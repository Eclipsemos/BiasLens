        "abstract": "The article argues that Pope Francis, intended to be a pontiff for the age of globalization, misjudged the political and cultural shifts in the West. The author suggests that the Catholic Church now needs a \"populist pope\" who can reconnect with the Western working class and embrace traditional moral teachings to attract converts. The article highlights the resurgence of traditionalism and religious interest, particularly among young men, as an opportunity for the Church.",
