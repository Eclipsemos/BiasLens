        "abstract": "The article argues that Pope Francis's papacy, intended for an era of globalization, misjudged the rise of populism and traditionalism in the West. It suggests the Catholic Church needs a \"populist pope\" who can connect with the Western working class and embrace traditional moral teachings to counter the trends of secularization and declining church attendance. The author believes a shift in strategy is necessary for the Church to evangelize the West anew.",
